# Simple TabPFN in C++

This repository contains a minimal and readable (for me?) C++ implementation of TabPFN using LibTorch.

The goal is that I can understand it again in three months. If so, I can maybe extend it and make everything nicer?

## Building

- Just use the Dockerfile.

- Or install libtorch manually...
